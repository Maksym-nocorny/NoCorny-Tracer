# Changelog

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-26 (Current)

### Fixed
- **Fatal Error on Launch**: Resolved a critical issue where the app would crash when loaded from a `.app` bundle due to the resource bundle not being found. Fixed by implementing a robust custom bundle locator in `NoCornyTracerApp.swift` that correctly targets the `Contents/Resources` directory.

### Improved
- **App Packaging**: Updated build and signing process to be fully compatible with macOS security requirements (avoiding unsealed contents in the bundle root).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Floating Camera**: Added support for a floating face cam while recording.
- **Improved UI**: New modern menu bar interface.
- **DMG Distribution**: Added automated build script for creating DMG installers.

## [1.2.1] - Earlier
- Initial releases and core recording functionality.
